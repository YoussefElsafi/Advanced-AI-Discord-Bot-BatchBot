### 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how your data is collected, used, and stored when using the Bot. By using the Bot, you consent to the practices outlined in this policy.

### 2. Data Collection

The Bot may collect the following user-related data:

- Usernames and Discord IDs.
- Messages and commands sent to the Bot. You can use `/reset` to delete your stored data at any time.

**Note:** If you are self-hosting the Bot using the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/YoussefElsafi/Advanced-AI-Discord-Bot-BatchBot), data handling is entirely your responsibility.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to self-hosted instances of the bot.

No personal information beyond what is publicly shared on Discord will be collected.

### 3. Data Usage

Collected data is used solely to:

- Provide and improve the Bot's features and functionality, specifically maintaining conversation history.
- Enhance performance and fix bugs.

### 4. Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties. Data is stored securely and will not be sold or shared for marketing purposes.

### 5. Data Retention

**On our official server:** All user data, including commands, messages, and any other interactions with the Bot, is automatically deleted every week to protect user privacy and enhance the Botâ€™s performance. This process is permanent and cannot be modified or disabled.

**Self-hosted instances:** Data retention is managed by the individual running the bot.

**Note:** Our official discord server is not ready **yet**, We are working hard to complete it as fast as possible.

### 6. Changes to this Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will announce any significant changes to this Privacy Policy in our official Discord server once it is launched. Until then, please check this policy periodically for updates.
